            <p>Irena Sendler. If you are like most of the world's population, myself included, you probably know very
                little if anything at all about this amazing woman. Up until 2016, I had never even heard the name Irena
                Sendler. I found her by accident while reading some World War II history, specifically about the
                Holocaust.
                What follows is just a brief summary of what I found out about this incredible human being.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1910 - Was born as Irena Krzyzanowski to the proud parents, Stanislaw
                    Krzyzanowski and Janina Krzyzanowski on February 15<sup>th</sup>
                </li>
                <li>
                    1927 - Studied law for two years and then Polish Literature at the University of Warsaw
                </li>
                <li>
                    1939 - As a Senior Administrator of Warsaw's Social Welfare Department, Irena is involved with
                    distributing financial help to orphans, the poor, the sick, and the elderly throughout Warsaw
                </li>
                <li>
                    1939 - Through the department, Irena starts to help the Jewish people by giving out medicine, money,
                    and clothing. She also makes up false names and tells German authorities that they are suffering
                    from typhus to prevent visits from German authorities
                </li>
                <li>
                    1940 - The Nazis force thousands of Jews into an area of Warsaw that would later be known as the
                    Warsaw Ghetto
                </li>
                <li>
                    1941 - A typhoid epidemic breaks out in the Warsaw Ghetto, where 6,000 people are dying each month
                    from starvation and disease. Irena would later obtain a pass from Warsaw's Epidemic Control
                    Department that would allow her and a colleague to enter the Ghetto legally. She re-establishes
                    contacts, brings food, medicines, and clothing to the occupants. It was here she decided to help the
                    Jewish children escape from their horrendous conditions
                </li>
                <li>
                    1942 - Rumors of the Nazis "Final Solution" begin circulating around the Warsaw Ghetto. The rumors
                    soon turned into a horrible realization as railroad cars began to arrive. Some 6,000 Jews were
                    deported daily to death camps. In September, the "Provisional Committee to aid Jews" is set up.
                    Later, in October, it would become known as "Zegota". In December Irena would be nominated by Zegota
                    to become the head of the children's section. Under the cover name of Jolanta and with the help of
                    her colleagues, she undertakes the task of organizing ways to smuggle Jewish children out of the
                    Ghetto and finding places for them to live safely
                </li>
                <li>
                    1943 - Two Jewish resistance organizations, the ZZW and ZOB take control of the Warsaw Ghetto. After
                    months of courageous resistance from the ZZW and ZOB, German soldiers, under the orders of Heinrich
                    Himmler, defeated the resistance. The Warsaw Ghetto was ordered to be leveled to rubble. Some 13,000
                    Jews had been killed and another 50,000 are captured and shipped to extermination camps. In October,
                    Irena is captured and tortured over the next several weeks. Despite the constant torture and pain
                    from broken limbs, she refused to give any information about her colleagues or the children she has
                    saved
                </li>
                <li>
                    1944 - After months of torture, in January, Irena is sentenced to be excuted. However, on the way to
                    her execution, Zegota managed to bribe a guard, allowing Irena to escape. She would go into hiding
                    but still managed to help some Jewish people escape from the evil hands of the Nazis. She also
                    manages to work for the Polish Red Cross as a nurse
                </li>
                <li>
                    1945 - On January 17<sup>th</sup>, Soviet and Polish troops march into the area, signaling the end
                    of what could be considered the most hellacious war that has ever existed, an evil that has never
                    been matched, and hopefully will never be matched again
                </li>
                <li>
                    2008 - On May 12<sup>th</sup>, Irena Sendler passed away at the age of 98 in Warsaw, Poland
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is estimated that Irena, along with her colleagues, saved over 2500 Jewish children. Irena Sendler's
                story doesn't end after the war ended. She went on to be awarded several of the world's most prestigious
                awards for her
                contributions to humankind, one of which is Poland's highest honor, the Order of the White Eagle
                (pictured below).

                <blockquote>
                    After World War II, it seemed that humanity understood something, and nothing like that would happen
                    again. Humanity has understood nothing. Religious, tribal, national wars continue. The world
                    continues
                    to be in a sea of blood. The world can be better if there's love, tolerance, and humility. -
